    <p>When you hear the term "web design," what do you think of? You may assume that a web designer designs websites, but that's not always the case. In some companies, a web designer is someone who has expertise in designing and executing a specific project. A web designer may be involved in every stage of the process, from planning to coding to content creation.</p>
    <p>In 2013, a trend began with some tools called static website generators where their workflow was greatly simplified so that anyone could build their own site without having to know how to code. This is because they're built on top of HTML5 standards and generate plain-text files for content which can then be shared across multiple servers through compatible technologies.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, generators such as Gatsby, Hugo, NextJS and Hexo have become mainstream alternatives to a traditional CMS. These new prosumer tools allow anyone to create a static website with ease through the use of smart defaults and flexibility for customization.</p>
    <p>Static websites have been around since the beginning, but they've become more common as our technology has evolved. In fact, static site generators are becoming more popular as CMS-based platforms require more technical knowledge and can be costlier from an administrative perspective. Static site generators are flexible enough for some businesses to prefer them over a traditional CMS-built website because they make it easy for content managers who don't know how to code, meaning that a company doesn't necessarily need a web designer on staff in order to build a dynamic site anymore. </p>
    <p>The downsides to static websites are that the sites are not as dynamic or personalized to visitors, they don't have all of the functionality of a CMS site, and if your website goes down, it's down until you bring it back up. But for many websites, this isn't necessarily a problem because typically, their content is archived online rather than being updated frequently.</p>
    <p>With that said, static generators aren't necessarily right for every business just yet. Some businesses may still need to utilize certain functionalities that can only be found in traditional CMS built websites . However, since the trend towards static building has become popularized with these new tools becoming available over the last few years, more businesses will likely follow suit in order to keep up with industry standards.</p>
    <p>The major downside to static websites is the lack of search functionality. A typical website with a backend can query the database when a user requests a search. But with a static website, there's no database to query.</p>
    <p>This is where Fluxstack comes in. By simply adding the API to the Javascript front end, full text search becomes a breeze.</p>
